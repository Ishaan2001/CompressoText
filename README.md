# CompressoText
Efficient tool to compress text files

Compresso Text uses **_huffman coding_** algorithm to efficiently reduce memory required to store any text file. In this project, rather than just presenting the working of the algorithm and generating huffman codes for characters like most other projects do, I have done actual implementation to optimize memory utilisation by operating at bit level of the text.
